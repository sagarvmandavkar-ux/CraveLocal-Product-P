# Product Requirements Document: "Nashville Street Eats" Feature

**Author:** [Your Name]
**Status:** In Development
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Overview & Problem Statement

**Problem:** While Nashville is a food destination, visitors and locals struggle to find and track the city's best food trucks and transient street food vendors, which often have variable locations and hours. Existing apps are geared towards traditional restaurants, leaving a gap in the market for spontaneous, local food discovery.

**Solution:** The "Nashville Street Eats" feature within the CraveLocal app will be a real-time map and directory dedicated to discovering, tracking, and reviewing local food trucks.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

### User Goals:
* Quickly find nearby food trucks.
* Filter options by cuisine type and price.
* See reviews and photos from other users.

### Business Goals:
* Increase daily active users (DAU) by 15% within 3 months of launch.
* Capture a new user segment interested in street food.
* Achieve a 4.5+ star rating for the new feature in the app store.

## 3. User Personas

* **The Foodie Tourist (Anna, 28):** Visiting Nashville for a long weekend. Wants to experience the most authentic and talked-about local food, not just tourist traps.
* **The Downtown Lunch-Breaker (Ben, 45):** Works downtown and has a limited lunch break. Wants to find a quick, delicious, and varied lunch option near his office.

## 4. Feature Requirements (User Stories)

* **US-01 (Map View):** As a user, I want to see food trucks plotted on a live map of Nashville so that I can understand their current location relative to me.
* **US-02 (Filtering):** As a user, I want to filter food trucks by cuisine (e.g., Tacos, BBQ, Pizza) so that I can find exactly what I'm craving.
* **US-03 (Vendor Profiles):** As a user, I want to tap on a food truck to view its profile, which includes its menu, photos, hours, and user reviews.
* **US-04 (Reviews):** As a user, I want to be able to leave a rating and a short review for a food truck so that I can share my experience with the community.

## 5. Technical Overview

This feature will be powered by a backend service that manages a database of food truck vendors. The data will be exposed to the mobile app via a REST API. A sample dataset (`data/vendors.csv`) and the proposed API endpoints (`api/endpoints.md`) are included in this repository.

## 6. Scope & Phasing (MVP)

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on launching in Nashville only and will include the core features of map view, filtering, and profiles. User-submitted reviews (US-04) will be considered for a future release (V2).
